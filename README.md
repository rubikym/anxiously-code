# anxiously-code
A place to get better in coding at your own pace.

## Why does this repository exist?
A lot of people who work in the IT industry are feeling anxious, because they can't improve their coding skills: infinite stream of new features, tight deadlines, low quality coding standards (and so on) do not give them an option to get better. Their only (and obvious) choice is to code in their free time. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to decide what to code, even more when you're new to programming. A few of my colleagues asked me to give them a few tasks, appropriate for their skill level, to solve, so why not? I've decided to create a repository with a list of programming tasks of different levels. We'll see where it would get us.

## What is this repository?
This repository is created as a place to gather both classical and applied coding problems. They can be solved in any language; the point is to try to produce reasonably optimal and idiomatic (in terms of your language of choice) solutions.

## How to use this repository?
1. Fork this repository;
2. Choose a task from the "issues" page (you can use filters to browse the tasks of different difficulties);
3. Find the materials (if any) for your chosen task under `/tasks/task-{issue number}/` directory (for example, `/tasks/task-13/`). You can also inspect the existing solutions by other people under `/solutions/` and decide to improve one);
4. Create some code under `/solutions/` and make a pull request to `development` branch. To keep the directory structure clean I assume `/solutions/task-{issue number}/{language-and-tech-stack-used}/{your-top-level-directory}` scheme should be followed, for example, `/solutions/task-13/C#-WPF/SimpleEditorSolution` or `/solutions/task-17/rust-Piston/MyChessCargoPackage`;
5. Feel free to leave comments on pull requests.

### _Conventions to follow_
1. _Please_, add `#{issue_number}` at the start of each commit message;
2. _Please_, describe what has been done in commit messages;
3. _Please_, name your pull requests meaningfully and don't forget to point to the issue your PR is related to.

## May I participate?
Sure thing, though I doubt that someone except my colleagues will ever find this repository.
